# EmoticonRevolution

EmoticonRevolution is THE emoticon pack that will take the internet by storm. Updated as often as possible, you WILL find the perfect emoji replacement-and be the coolest one in the group chat. Find an emoticon missing? Say something in the Issues tab, and I'll take care of it as soon as I see it! 

EmoticonRevolution was developed by myself and ChatGPT, providing the inspiration to put the emoticons on GitHub, and prodviding some awesome emoticons as well.

EmoticonRevolution is licensed under the MIT License. Permission is granted to use these emoticons as you wish, but you may not take credit for the emoticon if you got it from this pack. I don't really care if you give me credit or not, but just don't take the credit for yourself. I made this on Aoril 13th 2025, but by the time you read this, I'll most likely have made some changes. If you take the emoticon and change it to be your own and take credit for it, please credit me with inspiration. Thanks for actually reading the license!
