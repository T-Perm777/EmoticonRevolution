# EmoticonRevolution

EmoticonRevolution is THE emoticon pack that will take the internet by storm. Updated as often as possible, you WILL find the perfect emoji replacement-and be the coolest one in the group chat (⌐■_■). Find an emoticon missing? Say something in the Issues tab, and I'll take care of it as soon as I see it! 

EmoticonRevolution was developed by myself and ChatGPT, providing the inspiration to put the emoticons on GitHub, and providing some awesome emoticons as well.

Want to make your own version? Copy/download the .txt file, or fork the repo if you want! Go to the top of the page, just above the files and to the right, and click 'Fork'. You can also go to 'Code' and copy the link,  open with GitHub desktop, or download the project as a .zip file.

EmoticonRevolution is licensed under the MIT License. Permission is granted to use these emoticons as you wish, but you may not take credit for the emoticon if you got it from this pack. I don't really care if you give me credit or not, but just don't take the credit for yourself. I made this on April 13th 2025, but by the time you read this, I'll most likely have made some changes. If you take the emoticon and change it to be your own and take credit for it, please credit me with inspiration. Thanks for actually reading the license!
